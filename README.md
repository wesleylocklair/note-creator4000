# Note Creator 4000
## Description
This application was made to be able to make notes online and store them in the database of the app! I received the starter code with no deployment or back end structure. As of the moment the application will deploy and is live! When you type in notes they save to the database as well as appear on the page! The delete button does not work just yet but I will be fixing that in the future!

## Credits
I used W3 schools and Mozilla for most of the server and back end!
W3 = https://www.w3schools.com/
Mozilla = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/3
