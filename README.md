# Note Creator 4000
## Description
This application was made to be able to make notes online and store them in the database of the app! I received the starter code with no deployment or back end structure. As of the moment the application will deploy and is live! I have ran into a few issues with the back end javascript and will be working on it in the future. As of right now the application saves the note information in the terminal when you run it. Once I make a few changes to the javascript all the notes will be saved in the browser (stay tuned!)

## Credits
I used W3 schools and Mozilla for most of the server and back end!
W3 = https://www.w3schools.com/
Mozilla = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/3
